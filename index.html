        <p>Wordle words are the collection of five-letter words that players guess while playing the Wordle game. Each daily puzzle uses one specific word from a pre-defined list, making it both a challenge and a learning experience.</p>

        <h2>How Wordle Words Are Chosen</h2>
        <p>The words in Wordle are selected from a carefully curated list. These words are meant to be common enough for most players to recognize but challenging enough to keep the game interesting. The creator, Josh Wardle, ensured that these words are suitable for players worldwide.</p>

            <li><strong>Challenging Words:</strong> Words like “fjord” or “nymph” test even the most skilled players.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Words:</strong> Occasionally, Wordle includes words related to holidays or seasons, such as “candy” for Halloween.</li>
        </ul>
